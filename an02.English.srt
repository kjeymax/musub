1
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,233
Let’s continue repairing together

2
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,333
Master sister

3
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,833
Why are you alone?

4
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,500
Master Zhang

5
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,066
Great, you're okay

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,833
Our talented people have already rescued the hero Ma Lianghan

7
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,000
Unexpectedly, he suddenly went crazy and attacked us

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,866
We chased him all the way here

9
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,700
why is that

10
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,200
Are they Yin Huangbao's spies?

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,366
Six Paths

12
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,400
The mission issued by the Lord is to rescue these people

13
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,766
There shouldn't be anything wrong

14
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,400
Huh, what do you know?

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
ah

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,966
Ahhhhhhh

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,000
he

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
He is Ma Daxia

19
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,233
Everyone, spread out quickly

20
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,366
They both have the same tactics

21
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,066
They are all bullying us because we are not familiar with the terrain.

22
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:30,166
I'm afraid they are powerful enough to be called ministers

23
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,466
This flower

24
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:25,866
Um

25
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Hahahahahaha

26
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,033
Ha ha

27
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
ah

28
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,433
Oops

29
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,300
kill him

30
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,433
kill him

31
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,766
Kill him

32
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
You're not

33
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,900
You two heroes, wake up quickly.

34
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,566
we are here to save you

35
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,300
7 Brother, I have a way

36
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
do you believe in light

37
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,566
Evergreen lives in darkness

38
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,700
They will definitely not be able to bear the moment they encounter bright light.

39
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,833
look at them

40
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,500
Everything is under control

41
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,800
kill me

42
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,666
Just kill me

43
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,600
there is a voice

44
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,700
There's a voice in my head

45
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:46,100
Hurry up and give me the divine point

46
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
what are you up to

47
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,833
i want to kill him

48
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,233
Revenge for Yan Xiaozhu

49
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,600
What about the mission to kill him?

50
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,766
Ah compared to the task

51
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,100
The little monk wants to go back alive

52
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,600
Is it your turn to speak?

53
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,700
If you kill him, you won't get any good deeds.

54
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,766
good deeds

55
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,300
Are good deeds more important than avenging relatives and friends?

56
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,633
Already entered this Shura field

57
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,633
How much is God’s life worth?

58
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:22,800
Isn’t it just for good deeds to do these 6 tasks?

59
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,366
Right is good deeds

60
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:26,600
who

61
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,966
Who's talking is what you've always wanted

62
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,833
No one speaks

63
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,833
Relatives and junior brothers

64
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,633
kill them

65
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
ah

66
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,100
Ahhhhhhh

67
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,766
This can't be considered as my killing.

68
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,000
Save Tan Wenbo

69
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,633
Escaped from the sea of ​​suffering controlled by Heart Seizer Pills

70
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Complete one of the side missions

71
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:18,200
Each participant will be rewarded with 10 points of good deeds.

72
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,733
Hand reward prompts Ma Lianghan to work side by side for heaven

73
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,000
Suddenly it turns out that killing them will do good deeds

74
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,433
Clean you and save Ma Lianghan successfully

75
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,966
Each participant will be rewarded with Shidingshan Gong

76
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,166
maybe for them

77
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,900
This is also a relief

78
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,000
If you don't leave, someone will come again

79
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,966
Brother Qingjing

80
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,566
The sound you said you heard just now

81
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,666
none of your business

82
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,600
It's too far apart and still can't be jumped over

83
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,433
Come and see

84
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,433
You are good at mechanism skills

85
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,633
Is there a solution?

86
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,833
I have never seen anything like this before and I dare not say so.

87
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,266
Isn't this a digital turntable?

88
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,866
Hum, let them also experience high-end operations

89
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,966
How about I give it a try?

90
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,700
The young monk still lets the seventh sister

91
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,200
sister

92
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
how

93
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
ah

94
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,900
The little monk once lived under the era

95
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,433
Acquire rewards from heaven

96
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,466
In the middle is what the Six-Nine Technique looks like.

97
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,366
It’s really like the yin and yang in your sect, Brother Zhang.

98
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,300
Everything is possible here

99
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,966
I guess just add up the corresponding numbers in the circles

100
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,100
Most of them are 69, which can be unlocked and closed immediately.

101
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,533
I can’t think of any little monk

102
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,766
Actually, even Tianfangbu’s writing is disappointing.

103
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,366
At any rate, I have heard of the orthodox nine-year compulsory education.

104
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,300
small case

105
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,166
smelly monk

106
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,100
ah

107
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:51,700
Sister, be careful

108
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,366
Little monk, be careful

109
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,200
Why

110
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,233
life and death

111
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,966
It's better for the Seventh Lord to come, eh?

112
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,000
Come out of nowhere

113
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,366
The door to life is open

114
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,666
This should be the key mechanism

115
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,366
I think it can be cracked by pulling this wooden hand

116
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,366
Yeah that simple

117
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,066
Hahaha, there is a way, there is a way

118
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,300
Be careful to ask my colleagues for directions, haha

119
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,866
Ahhh

120
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,833
Pull me up quickly

121
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,666
I clearly see a road

122
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,900
It's an illusion

123
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:51,233
Come out of nowhere

124
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,866
come dance

125
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Ah I know

126
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,000
I think this hand tells us to go with it

127
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,466
Just follow him in

128
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,500
So push

129
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,766
We pulled him out from the front

130
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,600
Why don't we just let him go with us?

131
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,566
Actually, I don’t think so.

132
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,200
Not necessarily unreasonable

133
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,300
Hey, hey, it's a matter of life and death

134
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,400
Should we believe this heterodox monk?

135
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,666
He can always think of unexpected ways

136
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,000
I want to believe him

137
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,866
So arrogant

138
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
Um

139
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,466
You hum

140
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,266
Junior Brother Zhending

141
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
Give it a try

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,433
Life or death is just a matter of fate

143
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,100
Come on, I hope those secret room guides don’t trick me.

144
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
I see

145
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,766
Master Zhending’s method of destroying officials is indeed a very clever idea.

146
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,900
The little monk is really not simple.

147
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,800
nothing wrong

148
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,866
Let's go

149
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,200
Ahhh

150
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,433
Run, run

151
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,400
What a good relative you are

152
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,100
go

153
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,233
soldiers

154
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,033
I'll sweep
