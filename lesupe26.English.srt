1
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,433
Once the spaceship is repaired, we can go to the outside world.

2
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,266
can my family be found there

3
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:41,033
Just like Vinnie

4
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,166
Vinny

5
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,166
wedding

6
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,600
leaves leaves leaves leaves facing

7
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,600
Start with me

8
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,066
Ye Chao Xingxing

9
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,466
Danger

10
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,900
Be careful to hide

11
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,733
become stronger become stronger

12
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,000
Become stronger by any means necessary

13
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,366
Become stronger, abandon everything and become stronger

14
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:13,566
This is the seed of black pepper

15
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,300
You know why you need to become stronger

16
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,200
More important than becoming stronger itself

17
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,966
It's a pity you don't know

18
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,500
I have people I want to protect I have

19
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Reasons for quitting

20
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,366
sad

21
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,266
nothing

22
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,300
you wanna die

23
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,866
Oops, he's going to die with the leaf insects.

24
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,900
Don't go

25
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,266
I remember when I sent the optical brain over

26
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,700
It's all about research

27
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,266
Accidents always happen

28
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,566
Just an accident and I want to cover it up

29
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,866
What matters is how to remedy

30
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,166
Make sure everything is back on track

31
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,800
Catch him for Blackfoot

32
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,300
Why are you making such a fool of yourself?

33
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,866
If your elder brother knew

34
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,600
What about your secret contact with us?

35
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,300
what will happen

36
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,866
Kill the Aurora Society professor and grab 2 reflective jackets

37
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,700
This is not like the famous Blue Star family

38
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,466
What a mecha kid should do, right?

39
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,100
The second young master threatened me

40
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Pass the order

41
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Capture this man in the name of the Presbyterian Church

42
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Must be captured alive

43
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
one or two

44
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,866
Just wait for me

45
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,233
I hacked into the Black Point Light Loop tower

46
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,833
They won't be able to catch up with him in a short time.

47
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,800
I always feel

48
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,766
overlooked something

49
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,866
What's wrong with you, No. 2?

50
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
Mo

51
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
sorry

52
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,833
In the end, we still couldnâ€™t keep the alpha light.

53
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,566
This is your best solution

54
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
Your chance of escape is only 8%

55
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,200
But you managed to grasp it

56
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,166
But you need alpha function

57
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,266
If you can take action

58
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,100
What does it matter if you can go to those guys?

59
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,633
Even if I can move

60
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,400
I won't help you either

61
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,300
Why

62
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,100
A fake driver has to experience countless life and death moments

63
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,666
Only then can it become a real accident, right?

64
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,900
What else can be done

65
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Don't worry

66
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:46,933
Don't worry, don't worry

67
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,266
All things coexist

68
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,966
There must be a corresponding antidote for poisons that are mutually exclusive

69
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,166
The antidote for the Potential Stimulating Fluid is right here

70
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The database is damaged and cannot be queried

71
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,233
Get the nearest blue starfish

72
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,033
There is a prosperous trading star

73
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,233
All major organizations have established offices there

74
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,433
Whether it's the Poetry Society

75
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,700
Jiguanghui or Medical Volunteer Alliance?

76
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,600
Wow is it really you?

77
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,433
Blue Starâ€™s annual World Affairs Competition

78
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,600
will you come

79
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,833
brave

80
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
yes
