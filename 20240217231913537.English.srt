1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,200
yeah

2
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,747
Excuse me, Chief

3
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:41,853
what up

4
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,347
take a look at this

5
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,067
The other day in a C-class dungeon raid.

6
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,827
Six people were killed in action.

7
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,080
The survivors are

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,788
He was a D-class and E-class hunter.

9
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,268
I guess he ran away

10
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,668
It's common

11
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,091
that is

12
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,108
Far from running away

13
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,948
I came out after defeating the boss.

14
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:00,882
DQ's Eugene Hoh Hunter

15
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:02,922
Because it was equipped with fairly expensive equipment.

16
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,840
It's never impossible

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,762
What do you want to say

18
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,402
Such suspicions should be investigated.

19
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:09,597
Oh no

20
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,282
In fact, there is another survivor

21
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:14,260
In the recent double dungeon incident

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,060
survived

23
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:16,882
It was Sung Jin Woo Hunter.

24
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:18,477
unknown

25
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,940
Moreover, one of the six people who died

26
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,660
It was Hwang Dong Seok Hunter

27
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,180
Is that Fandon Hunter's brother?

28
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,456
it definitely catches on

29
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:38,103
I'm home

30
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,543
Welcome back

31
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:40,783
a

32
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:41,656
Eo souvenir

33
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,376
fried chicken

34
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:44,856
Something good happened

35
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,936
Is it a good thing or not?

36
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,136
I don't know yet

37
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,020
Mother's medical expenses and living expenses

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,976
Because it has been removed properly

39
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:54,596
Stingy older brother is rare

40
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:55,563
It's okay

41
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,316
by the way

42
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,836
What was it like during this time?

43
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,243
yeah

44
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,083
raid

45
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:05,516
Was there a lot of reward?

46
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:06,640
For that reason

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,196
I wasn't hurt too much

48
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,516
I guess my friends were strong.

49
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:14,836
oh dear

50
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:16,276
That's right

51
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:19,123
Then it was easy to make enemies.

52
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,923
It sure was easy

53
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,043
Regardless of the difference in power

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,530
that moment

55
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,069
I had no hesitation

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,770
rather

57
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,629
Even someone like you is here for me

58
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,680
Previously

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,360
definitely

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,930
I should have looked for a way to escape.

61
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,140
By leveling up

62
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,330
Have you become angry?

63
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,970
But the opponent is not a monster

64
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,430
It's human.

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,130
Big brother

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,330
It's okay, I'm sick.

67
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,515
I felt like I forgot to get the change.

68
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:54,515
It was a misunderstanding

69
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:55,604
Haa

70
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:57,955
You'll be surprised already

71
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,214
It's fine now

72
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:05,500
What's important is

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,214
Be strong for your family

74
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,505
not die

75
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,414
I will do it even if the same situation arises again.

76
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:14,945
what

77
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,174
harmful ingredients

78
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,224
that

79
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:20,304
Detoxify

80
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,814
Mr. Feast

81
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,414
I'm gonna eat it all

82
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:32,094
Don't make a fuss that you're fat again

83
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,194
I can't get drunk at all

84
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,480
The system's special abilities

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,954
decomposes alcohol

86
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:50,874
Is it some kind of effect?

87
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:54,485
bless

88
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:57,077
healthy days

89
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,557
damaged body

90
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,077
Toxicity and abnormal immunity

91
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,363
This is it

92
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,596
Rewards for 20 dungeons

93
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:08,876
Too many things are happening so check it out

94
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:09,763
I didn't do it

95
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,516
The lost parts have been regenerated

96
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:13,596
Was it because of this?

97
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,556
There are still many things we don't know

98
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:23,613
big brother

99
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,093
I got a call from a friend called Mr. Ho.

100
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:27,146
picture

101
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:30,026
I'm going now

102
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:32,653
drinking too much

103
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,693
It's poisonous to my body. I'm fine.

104
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:41,014
Even if I become a doctor, I won't stop looking at you.

105
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:43,385
sorry

106
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,774
I suddenly called you

107
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,894
I never thought we'd meet again

108
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:48,094
Oh, I'm so happy

109
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,494
My brother is a lifesaver

110
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:51,945
ah

111
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,254
I also gave away the magic stone.

112
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,494
It was helpful to have you say that.

113
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:56,804
And you

114
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,244
You kept quiet about that time.

115
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:01,324
Oh that is

116
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,140
Those guys

117
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,380
He tried to kill me first.

118
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,180
Isn't it?

119
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:05,804
It's self-defense

120
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,988
So the requirements are

121
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,588
It says that my brother Minoru clouded my attack team.

122
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:14,611
picture

123
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,868
Oh no

124
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,428
Until the end anyway

125
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,120
For Bonbon fun

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,308
I have no intention of dating

127
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:22,344
20

128
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,384
home

129
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,815
At least 19 times

130
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,424
19 times

131
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,615
I never expected to become a guild master.

132
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,815
Please just listen to the story

133
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,015
please

134
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:38,604
So

135
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:40,444
a

136
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:41,644
yes

137
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:44,636
As you can imagine

138
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm the guild master

139
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,356
I want to get a license for

140
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,436
One of the conditions for this is

141
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:50,400
raid experience

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,276
Be a hunter 20 times or more

143
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,396
The other day was the first time

144
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:56,740
to take over the company

145
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,923
I've only been studying

146
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,763
I am confident in the written test

147
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:01,276
but

148
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,516
The practice is

149
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,529
By the way, he's the second son of a manned construction worker.

150
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,160
I want to be a guild master

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,049
It's for the company

152
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,590
actually

153
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,329
My father was trying to form a guild.

154
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,569
Manned construction is a guild

155
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,070
yes

156
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,496
Dungeons are dangerous

157
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:23,296
There are so many treasures sleeping

158
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:25,920
Magic stones and mana ores

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,216
only part of it

160
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,280
The corpses of high-ranking monsters

161
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,936
used for various materials

162
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,443
What's inside the dungeon

163
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,483
You can say it all comes down to money.

164
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,680
In other words, become a hunter of company income.

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Conquer the dungeon

166
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,723
make a profit

167
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,723
Is self-sufficiency the goal?

168
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,242
That's right

169
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,300
My father is an escu hunter

170
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,197
appointed as master

171
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,317
What do you want me to do as a deputy master?

172
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:50,357
Trying to run the guild like a company

173
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:51,437
What is SQ?

174
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,517
There are only seven people in the country.

175
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:54,802
Yeah

176
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:57,397
And he's the only one who hasn't joined a guild.

177
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:58,637
minbyung hunter is

178
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,037
I'm already retired

179
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,877
Are you planning on pulling it from someone else?

180
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,605
It's better to stop

181
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:08,000
pulled out

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,325
earn a grudge from the guild

183
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:11,565
My brother is not an awakened person

184
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:12,805
can't be master

185
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,245
Then you gain experience and become a master.

186
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,128
fight with your brother

187
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,900
Big brother also hides his ability

188
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,208
To participate in the raid

189
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,568
You need friends, right?

190
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:24,500
Me too

191
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,128
Rather than partnering with a high-rank hunter

192
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,480
Bring an E-class hunter with you

193
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,808
It's better to have a successful raid

194
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,568
It will be easier to convince my father

195
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:33,675
My brother is a B class

196
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,235
No, there is more power than that.

197
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,995
If you choose the wrong person, your life may be at risk.

198
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,205
If it's your brother

199
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:45,814
this is

200
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,585
In the building planned to be used as the guild's office.

201
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,985
Current estimated time is 30 billion

202
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,945
This is a raid reward prepared for my brother.

203
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,592
30 billion in 19 paid raids

204
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,272
This is an amount that would have jumped at once.

205
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:03,727
But

206
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,152
I'm the only one who can level up

207
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,512
Now that's a different story

208
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,684
If we can continue to grow like this

209
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,084
Someday you'll love me

210
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:13,555
no

211
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,684
You might be able to aim for more than that.

212
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,528
Considering that, 30 billion is money spent.

213
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:20,991
More than anything

214
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,688
ability to level up

215
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:25,160
How does it affect me?

216
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,880
without knowing

217
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,888
teaming up with others

218
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,168
high risk

219
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,328
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,368
please wait

221
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,889
If you cooperate

222
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,609
I'll keep my brother a secret for the rest of my life.

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Ugh

224
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,240
Damn it

225
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,640
I would like to know information about the two survivors.

226
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Please bring me the materials immediately.

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Excuse me

228
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
I've been waiting for you

229
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,280
mr fan

230
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,948
my brother was killed

231
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,371
picture

232
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,348
What is it that confirms fertilizer?

233
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:20,468
Yes here

234
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:22,531
roller

235
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,308
What happens if I go out and kill someone?

236
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,268
Are you serious

237
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:34,580
in hunter crime

238
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,660
extradition treaty

239
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,247
If the country has concluded

240
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,207
be judged according to local law

241
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,887
But if not

242
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,367
You will be judged according to the laws of your home country.

243
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:46,578
In other words

244
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,741
Depends on negotiations with the government

245
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,181
Is it possible to have a reduced sentence?

246
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,621
Please adjust your schedule.

247
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,700
A sudden change of plans

248
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,581
It will interfere with the guild's operations.

249
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,701
How long will it be filled?

250
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:01,661
Until a while

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,939
It's okay after that

252
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,939
hold it down

253
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,499
I got it

254
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,619
I'll put it in my schedule

255
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,659
D class hunter friend cannon

256
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,859
D-class hunter Magojiro

257
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,555
I hope you're still alive until then

258
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:21,555
It's just amazing

259
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:29,193
It's rare for you to move your body.

260
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,433
If you're just studying

261
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:32,953
It's bad for your body, isn't it?

262
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,166
picture

263
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,473
You're eating too much chicken

264
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,206
Hmm

265
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:44,326
Hey

266
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,513
What would you do if you got 30 billion?

267
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:47,846
What suddenly?

268
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:49,593
What if?

269
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,165
Mom's medical expenses and

270
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:53,925
Should I go to university?

271
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:55,194
After

272
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,354
Yeah

273
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:57,954
saving

274
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:00,445
I don't know, it's not realistic

275
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:03,325
that's right

276
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:06,525
you come at your own pace

277
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,565
Hey brother

278
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,220
Hunter forever

279
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,268
yes

280
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,211
No, no

281
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:24,851
11 km

282
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:26,600
Why

283
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,720
distance greater than the target

284
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,691
It's being counted

285
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:34,982
Naruho

286
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,657
Let's see how far it will go

287
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:42,977
big brother

288
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,537
Yay, I caught up

289
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,697
I'll run a little more.

290
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,165
It stopped at exactly double

291
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:58,725
Then the rest too

292
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,064
Daily quest

293
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,344
changed to secret quest

294
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,215
yes

295
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,064
random selection box

296
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:17,920
Well, first of all

297
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,704
It's a blessed random box.

298
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,500
Also the key

299
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,669
devil's castle

300
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,469
Ease of getting started

301
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,490
Ahaha

302
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
yeah

303
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:53,033
Cure all diseases with powerful magical power

304
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,393
Earthquake of life

305
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,845
It's like a flood of life

306
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:07,020
Really

307
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,125
If all diseases could be cured

308
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:12,365
It has been decided

309
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:22,960
Difficulty in obtaining keys

310
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,430
If it's proportional to the dungeon

311
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,810
The dungeon sq that opens with this

312
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,609
If so

313
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:29,620
Inside is

314
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,110
Those rescue hunters failed.

315
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,200
Jeju Island level

316
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,680
waiting

317
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,550
It turns out that

318
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,308
To those monsters from different dimensions

319
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,068
Will I be able to pass now?

320
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:57,008
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared

321
00:14:58,512 --> 00:14:59,768
When it's really dangerous

322
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:01,200
In an instance dungeon

323
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Didn't use it

324
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,008
You can use engine stones

325
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,656
yeah

326
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,703
That's it if you give up

327
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,143
I become stronger

328
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:16,543
Level up more

329
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,303
get everything back

330
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,663
Can you hold your breath in a place like this?

331
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,393
Almost only down

332
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,740
Applied to the other side of the front

333
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,540
Is this it?

334
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
or

335
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,400
It was

336
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,880
warn

337
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,566
1/3 was removed in an instant

338
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,400
Double firepower value

339
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Fast

340
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,523
Another half

341
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:55,523
it can not be helped

342
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,763
the first pirate

343
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,120
yeah

344
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:49,460
A series of warnings

345
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,460
Please report the critical situation

346
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,020
Are you trying not to let me die?

347
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,180
Because I'm a player

348
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,139
Something like this

349
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,460
No matter what you think

350
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,820
It's not a normal reconfirmation.

351
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,232
At least three minutes

352
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,087
If you can survive your anger

353
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:07,447
No, it's impossible, it's too dangerous

354
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,340
how

355
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,498
I'm telling you to survive

356
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,943
A few more shots and it's over.

357
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,143
Is there any way

358
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,023
I forgot about the store

359
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:42,383
Purchased 303 pieces each.

360
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,516
Only one hundred?

361
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:52,203
It's like this

362
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,683
far away

363
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:57,812
Excessive drinking

364
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,532
It's poisonous to my body. I'm fine.

365
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:03,652
There is no choice but to do

366
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
yes

367
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay

368
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,580
can move

369
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:43,915
Skill effect expired

370
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,700
Run away

371
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,600
yeah

372
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
yeah

373
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,912
Is it an obtainable item?

374
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:36,847
Also the key

375
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:38,647
this is

376
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,952
Is it the one that Cerberus was protecting?

377
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:43,487
what

378
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:51,368
design of life flooding

379
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,487
This time I realized my strength

380
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,847
If you go into the castle now, you'll definitely die.

381
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,552
But

382
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:06,127
I'll be back soon

383
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:08,272
surely

384
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,880
A little after

385
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,988
Sorry, one second, one second mirror

386
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,800
yeah
